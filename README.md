# **MyReads Project**

This is my finished project for the React Nanodegree from Udacity, This project is meant to demonstrate a basic understanding of State Management in React. A starter code was used in starting this project that consisted of a static template without the logic which can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd0191-c1-myreads/)

## **Installation**

To install the project:

- clone the repository in your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/youssef-ash/bookshelf-app
```

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
- navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## **Backend Server**

The backend server and API used in this project is provided by Udacity, for information about it's methods refer to [Udacity's repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd0191-c1-myreads/).

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## **Create React App**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).
